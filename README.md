Differential Bearing Puller

Aug 2016 - Project @ Tesla

In order to save perfectly good differentials, we need to replace the top and bottom bearing on each. The top bearing is easy to remove 
since you can get underneath it and pull it off. However, you cannot get underneath the bottom bearing. So I collaborated with
our machinist to develop a puller that would clamp and pull the bearing off without damaging the differntial. 

The idea behind it is to have a shaft collar clamp onto the outside diameter of the bearing and then pull this shaft collar + bearing up
while keeping the differential down. We do this by using a power screw that is threaded into the collar+bearing assembly and pushing
against what I called a screw race. This screw race allows the power screw to push against the differential while rotating freely.
